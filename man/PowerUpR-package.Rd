\title{Power Analysis Tools for Multilevel Randomized Experiments}
\description{
  \emph{PowerUp!} series consist of three excel-based applications to design various multilevel randomized experiments to detect main treatment effects, and to design two- and three-level cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) to detect multilevel moderation and mediation.
