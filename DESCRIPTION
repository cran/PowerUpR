Description: 
 Includes tools to calculate statistical power, minimum detectable effect size (MDES), MDES difference (MDESD), and minimum required sample size for various multilevel randomized experiments with continuous outcomes. Some of the functions can assist with planning two- and three-level cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) sensitive to moderation effects, and with planning two-level CRTs sensitive to 2-2-1 and 2-1-1 mediation effects.
