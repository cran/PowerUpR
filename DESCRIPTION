Description: 
 Statistical power analysis tools for designing multilevel randomized experiments.
 Includes functions to calculate statistical power (1 - type II error), minimum detectable effect size (MDES),
 minimum required sample size (MRSS), functions to solve constrained optimal sample allocation (COSA) problems,
 and to visualize duo or trio relationships between statistical power, MDES, MRSS, and a component of COSA.
