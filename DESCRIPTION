  Statistical power analysis tools for designing individual or cluster randomized trials.
 Includes functions to calculate statistical power (1 - type II error), minimum detectable effect size (MDES),
 minimum required sample size (MRSS), functions to solve constrained optimal sample allocation (COSA) problems,
 and to visualize duo or trio relationships between statistical power, MDES, MRSS, and COSA.
