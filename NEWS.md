### Changes in PowerUpR v0.2.3
 - documented functions by designs
 - efficiency improvements, better error handling
 - removed constrained optimal sample allocation functions. See [`cosa`]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cosa) package
 - simplified MRSS functions
 - changed title 
 
### Changes in PowerUpR v0.1.3
 - added citation info, vignettes, some object conversion functions 
 - changed title 
 - fixed minor typos

### Initially in PowerUpR v0.1.2
 - statistical power analysis of main effects 
 with continious outcomes 
 - functions to calculate statistical power, MDES, MRSS,
 and to solve COSA problems under various constraints.
 - function to visualize type I and type II
 error rates for didactic purpose. 
 - functions to visualize duo and trio relatioship
 between statistical power, MDES, MRSS, and COSA.
